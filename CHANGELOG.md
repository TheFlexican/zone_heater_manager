## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.4] - 2025-12-06

### ✨ New Features - Development Logging System

**Per-Area Logging**
- **Dedicated Logs Tab**: New tab in area details showing comprehensive heating strategy logs
  - Displays all heating decisions and events for development visibility
  - Color-coded event type badges for easy identification
  - Chronological order (newest first) with timestamps
  - Detailed JSON data for each event showing exact parameters

**Event Types Tracked**
- **Temperature**: Target temperature calculations and effective temperature changes

- **Schedule**: Schedule activations with preset modes or temperature values
- **Smart Boost**: Smart night boost predictions, start times, and duration estimates
- **Sensor**: Window and presence sensor state changes (open/closed, detected/not detected)
- **Mode**: Manual override mode entries and exits

**Filtering & Controls**
- Filter dropdown to view specific event types or all events
- Refresh button to reload logs on demand
- Limit of 500 entries per area (memory-efficient with deque)
- API endpoint: `GET /api/smart_heating/areas/{area_id}/logs?limit=N&type=EVENT_TYPE`

**Backend Implementation**
- New `AreaLogger` class with `log_event()`, `get_logs()`, `clear_logs()` methods
- Integrated throughout climate controller and scheduler
- Logs preserved in memory (development tool, not persisted to disk)

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Coordinator Lookup**: Fixed multiple `AttributeError` issues where `area_logger` was incorrectly identified as coordinator
  - Updated exclusion lists in `api.py` (17 occurrences) and `websocket.py` (2 occurrences)
  - WebSocket connections now work correctly without "unknown_error"
  - Manual override and other API endpoints no longer fail with attribute errors

## [0.5.3] - 2025-12-06

### ✨ Improved - Smart Night Boost & Schedule Integration

**Smart Night Boost Enhancements**
- **Schedule-Aware Targeting**: Smart night boost now reads morning schedules automatically
  - Detects first morning schedule (between 00:00-12:00) as target time
  - Falls back to configured `smart_night_boost_target_time` if no schedule exists
  - Calculates optimal heating start time based on predicted heating duration
  - Uses schedule's preset mode or temperature as target

**Night Boost Schedule Coordination**
- **Schedule Precedence**: Regular night boost no longer overlaps with active schedules
  - Night boost only applies when NO schedule is active
  - Allows schedules (e.g., "sleep" preset 22:00-06:30) to take precedence
  - Night boost pre-heats BEFORE morning schedule starts, not during
  - Better coordination between manual night boost and scheduled presets

**Example Use Case**
- Schedule: Saturday 22:00 - Sunday 07:00 (sleep preset)
- Smart night boost: Detects 07:00 schedule, predicts heating time needed
- Starts heating at optimal time (e.g., 06:30) to reach target by 07:00
- Regular night boost: Only active when outside schedule periods

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-06

### 🐛 Fixed
- **WebSocket Schedule Bug**: Fixed schedules disappearing from frontend after WebSocket updates
  - Coordinator now includes schedules in area data sent via WebSocket
  - Previously, WebSocket updates overwrote area data without schedules
  - Schedule tab now shows schedules consistently even after real-time updates

## [0.5.1] - 2025-12-06

- **Default Behavior**: Enabled (true) - switches automatically turn off when heating stops
- **Optional Always-On Mode**: Disable setting to keep pumps running continuously regardless of heating demand
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Enable for energy efficiency (pumps off when not needed)
  - Disable for systems requiring continuous circulation
  - Perfect for zone valves that need constant pump pressure

**Implementation:**
- Added `shutdown_switches_when_idle` property to Area class
- Persistence: Saved/loaded from storage like other area settings
- Climate controller checks setting before turning off switches
- Frontend UI: Toggle switch in Area Settings → Switch/Pump Control section

- **Issue**: While `manual_override` flag was saved to storage, it wasn't being loaded during startup
- **Solution**: Added `manual_override` to both `Area.to_dict()` and `Area.from_dict()` methods in `area_manager.py`
- **Impact**: Users' manual thermostat adjustments are now preserved even after HA restarts/updates
- **Affected Files**:
  - `smart_heating/area_manager.py`: Added persistence for `manual_override` flag

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-06

### ✨ Added - Manual Override Mode & Real-Time Updates

**Manual Override Mode**
- **Automatic Detection**: System detects when thermostat is adjusted outside the app (e.g., directly on Google Nest)
- **State Change Listeners**: Real-time monitoring of thermostat temperature changes via Home Assistant state events
- **Debouncing**: 2-second delay to handle rapid temperature dial adjustments (prevents flood of updates)
- **Manual Override Flag**: Area enters "MANUAL" mode when external adjustment detected
  - Orange "MANUAL" badge displayed on area card
  - App stops automatic temperature control for that area
  - Target temperature updated to match external setting
  - Manual override persists across restarts (saved to storage)
- **Clear Override**: Manual mode automatically cleared when user adjusts temperature via app
- **Backend Components**:
  - `coordinator.py`: State change listeners with debounce logic
  - `area_manager.py`: Added `manual_override` property to Area class
  - `climate_controller.py`: Skips areas in manual override mode
  - `api.py`: Clears manual override on temperature API calls

**Real-Time WebSocket Updates**
- **Frontend Updates**: Area cards update within 2-3 seconds of external thermostat changes
- **WebSocket Message Format**: Fixed to properly handle `result` type messages with area data
- **Object-to-Array Conversion**: Backend sends areas as object (dict), frontend converts to array
- **State Preservation**: Hidden area state preserved during WebSocket updates
- **Forced Coordinator Refresh**: Immediate data update after debounce completes (not rate-limited)

**Data Completeness Fixes**
- **Area ID**: Added `id` property to coordinator area data (fixes navigation after WebSocket updates)
- **Device Names**: Added `name` property with `friendly_name` from Home Assistant (fixes device display)
- **Hidden Property**: Backend now includes `hidden` flag in coordinator data (persistent across updates)

### 🔧 Fixed
- Area cards not clickable after WebSocket updates (missing `id` property)
- Device names showing entity IDs instead of friendly names after updates
- Hidden areas becoming visible after WebSocket updates
- Frontend not detecting WebSocket area updates (message type mismatch)

  - Automatic conversion between day names (Monday) and abbreviations (mon)
  - Backward compatible with old format (time, days)
  - Schedule creation from frontend now works seamlessly

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Device Status Display**: Fixed device status text in area cards
  - Thermostats now show "20.0°C → 22.0°C" only when heating (target > current)
  - Temperature sensors show "19.5°C" from temperature attribute
  - Valves show "45%" without redundant state value
  - All devices show "unavailable" instead of type name when no data
- **Scheduler Object Access**: Fixed scheduler to work with Schedule objects instead of dicts
  - Changed from `schedule["day"]` to `schedule.day`
  - Changed from `schedules` list to `schedules.values()` dict iteration
- **Thermostat Target Sync**: Climate controller now updates thermostat targets even when area is idle
  - Ensures TRV displays match scheduled temperatures
  - Passes target_temp to `_async_set_area_heating` in both heating and idle states

### 🔧 Changed
- **Temperature Conversion**: Added Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion in coordinator
  - Mock temperature sensors reporting 67.1°F now display as 19.5°C
  - Conversion applied before display and climate control logic

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README with current v0.1.0 changelog and architecture section
- Added device control flow diagram explaining TRV behavior
- Updated schedule API documentation with new format

    - Red flame icon when actively heating
    - Blue thermostat icon when idle
    - Status text shows "heating · 19.5°C → 21°C"
  - **Temperature Sensors**: Show current temperature reading with green sensor icon
  - **Valves**: Display position percentage and open/closed state
    - Orange icon when valve is open (position > 0)
    - Status text shows "75% · open"
  - **Switches**: Show on/off state with color-coded power icons
  - Color-coded icons provide instant visual feedback of device states
  - All device states update automatically every 30 seconds via coordinator

- **Real-time Device State Updates**: Area overview now shows immediate feedback when temperature changes
  - Device states (heating/idle/off) update instantly when temperature is adjusted
  - Thermostat HVAC action (heating/idle) reflected in real-time
  - Valve positions and switch states update immediately
  - WebSocket pushes device state changes to frontend within 1-2 seconds
  - Coordinator includes full device state information with type-specific attributes
  - Temperature changes trigger immediate climate control execution

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Device Display Names**: Area cards now show human-readable device names (e.g., "Living Room Thermostat") instead of entity IDs (e.g., "climate.living_room")
  - API endpoints `/api/smart_heating/areas` and `/api/smart_heating/areas/{id}` now include `name` field in device objects
  - Device names are extracted from Home Assistant entity state's `friendly_name` attribute
  - Improves UX when assigning devices to areas via drag-and-drop
