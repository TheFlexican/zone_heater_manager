## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-04

### ✨ Added - Adaptive Learning System

**Smart Night Boost with Machine Learning**
- Adaptive learning engine that predicts optimal heating start times based on your home's unique characteristics
- Automatic tracking of every heating cycle with timestamps, temperatures, and outdoor conditions
- Weather correlation using outdoor temperature sensors to learn how weather affects heating time
- Predictive scheduling based on historical data and current conditions
- Home Assistant Statistics API integration for efficient database storage (SQLite/MariaDB)
- Learning statistics tracked per area:
  - Heating rate (°C per minute) - how quickly your room warms up
  - Cooldown rate - how quickly it cools down
  - Outdoor temperature correlation - impact of weather on heating performance
  - Prediction accuracy metrics - continuous improvement tracking
- Configurable target wake-up time per area (e.g., "have bedroom at 21°C by 06:00")
- 10-minute safety margin for predictions to ensure target is reached on time
- Continuous learning improves accuracy over time with more data
- Minimal performance impact - predictions calculated once per minute

**Frontend UI for Adaptive Learning**
- New "Smart Night Boost" section in Settings tab:
  - Enable/disable toggle for adaptive learning per area
  - Time picker for target wake-up time with 24-hour format
  - Weather sensor entity selector (optional but recommended)
  - Informational panel explaining the learning system
  - Real-time configuration updates via service calls
- New "Learning" tab (6th tab in AreaDetail page):
  - Current learning status and configuration display
  - Step-by-step explanation of the learning process
  - API endpoint reference for developers
  - Helpful placeholder when feature is disabled
- User-friendly Material-UI components matching Home Assistant theme
- Instant feedback on configuration changes

**API Enhancements**

  - `weather_entity_id` (string) - Entity ID of outdoor temperature sensor
- Backward compatible with existing manual night boost configuration

**Technical Implementation**
- New `learning_engine.py` module (450+ lines of production code):
  - `HeatingEvent` dataclass for tracking individual heating cycles
  - `LearningEngine` class with full HA Statistics API integration
  - Methods: `async_start_heating_event()`, `async_end_heating_event()`, `async_predict_heating_time()`

  - Records outdoor temperature with each event via `_async_get_outdoor_temperature()` helper
  - Automatic event lifecycle management (start when heating begins, end when target reached)
  - Calls learning engine methods at appropriate times
- Scheduler integration:
  - New `_handle_smart_night_boost()` method for predictive scheduling
  - Calculates optimal heating start time based on learning data
  - 10-minute safety margin implementation
  - Falls back to default schedule if insufficient learning data

  - Added optional `ATTR_NIGHT_BOOST_START_TIME` and `ATTR_NIGHT_BOOST_END_TIME` to schema
- **Method Signature Errors**: Fixed parameter name mismatches in learning engine calls
  - Changed climate controller to use correct parameter names (current_temp not start_temp/target_temp)
  - Fixed `async_start_heating_event()` and `async_end_heating_event()` signatures
- **WebSocket Coordinator Lookup**: Fixed "'LearningEngine' object has no attribute 'async_add_listener'" error
  - Added "learning_engine" to both coordinator filter lists in `websocket.py`
  - Now properly excludes: history, climate_controller, schedule_executor, learning_engine

  - Automatic cleanup of old statistics via HA's built-in retention policies
- Minimal performance impact:
  - Predictions calculated only once per minute (not every 30-second cycle)
  - Database queries optimized for historical data retrieval
  - Statistics aggregation handled by HA's recorder component
- Memory efficient:
  - Heating events tracked in-memory only during active heating
  - No long-term in-memory caching of historical data
  - Statistics API provides on-demand data access

### 🎯 User Experience
