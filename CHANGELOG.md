## [Unreleased]

### ✨ Added
- **Unified Schedule Format**: Schedule model now supports both legacy and new formats

  - Automatic conversion between day names (Monday) and abbreviations (mon)
  - Backward compatible with old format (time, days)
  - Schedule creation from frontend now works seamlessly

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Device Status Display**: Fixed device status text in area cards
  - Thermostats now show "20.0°C → 22.0°C" only when heating (target > current)
  - Temperature sensors show "19.5°C" from temperature attribute
  - Valves show "45%" without redundant state value
  - All devices show "unavailable" instead of type name when no data
- **Scheduler Object Access**: Fixed scheduler to work with Schedule objects instead of dicts
  - Changed from `schedule["day"]` to `schedule.day`
  - Changed from `schedules` list to `schedules.values()` dict iteration
- **Thermostat Target Sync**: Climate controller now updates thermostat targets even when area is idle
  - Ensures TRV displays match scheduled temperatures
  - Passes target_temp to `_async_set_area_heating` in both heating and idle states

### 🔧 Changed
- **Temperature Conversion**: Added Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion in coordinator
  - Mock temperature sensors reporting 67.1°F now display as 19.5°C
  - Conversion applied before display and climate control logic

### 📚 Documentation

## [Unreleased]

### ✨ Added

  - **Thermostats**: Display HVAC action (heating/idle), current temperature, and target temperature
    - Red flame icon when actively heating
    - Blue thermostat icon when idle
    - Status text shows "heating · 19.5°C → 21°C"
  - **Temperature Sensors**: Show current temperature reading with green sensor icon
  - **Valves**: Display position percentage and open/closed state
    - Orange icon when valve is open (position > 0)
    - Status text shows "75% · open"
  - **Switches**: Show on/off state with color-coded power icons
  - Color-coded icons provide instant visual feedback of device states
  - All device states update automatically every 30 seconds via coordinator

- **Real-time Device State Updates**: Area overview now shows immediate feedback when temperature changes
  - Device states (heating/idle/off) update instantly when temperature is adjusted
  - Thermostat HVAC action (heating/idle) reflected in real-time
  - Valve positions and switch states update immediately
  - WebSocket pushes device state changes to frontend within 1-2 seconds
  - Coordinator includes full device state information with type-specific attributes
  - Temperature changes trigger immediate climate control execution

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Device Display Names**: Area cards now show human-readable device names (e.g., "Living Room Thermostat") instead of entity IDs (e.g., "climate.living_room")
  - API endpoints `/api/smart_heating/areas` and `/api/smart_heating/areas/{id}` now include `name` field in device objects
  - Device names are extracted from Home Assistant entity state's `friendly_name` attribute
  - Improves UX when assigning devices to areas via drag-and-drop
