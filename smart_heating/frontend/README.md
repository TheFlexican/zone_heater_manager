# Smart Heating Frontend

This is the React-based frontend for the Smart Heating Home Assistant integration.

## Features

- 🎨 **Material-UI v6** - Beautiful, responsive design matching Home Assistant theme
- ⚡ **Vite 6** - Lightning-fast development and build
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration for instant feedback
- 🖱️ **Drag & Drop** - Easy device assignment with react-beautiful-dnd
- 📊 **Interactive Charts** - Temperature history visualization with Recharts
- 📱 **Responsive** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 🌙 **Dark Theme** - Matches Home Assistant's native dark theme
- 🔒 **TypeScript** - Type-safe development

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
cd custom_components/smart_heating/frontend
npm install
```

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:5173` with hot reloading enabled.

The Vite dev server is configured to proxy API requests to your Home Assistant instance.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory, which will be served by Home Assistant.

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run type-check
```

## Architecture

  - Custom date/time range picker with start/end inputs
  - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
  - Visual indicators for heating periods

### Hooks

- **useWebSocket** - Custom hook for real-time WebSocket communication

### API Client

The `src/api.ts` file contains all API interaction functions:
- `getZones()` - Fetch all areas
- `createZone()` - Create a new area
- `deleteZone()` - Delete a area
- `setZoneTemperature()` - Update area target temperature
- `enableZone()` / `disableZone()` - Control area state
- `addDeviceToZone()` / `removeDeviceFromZone()` - Manage area devices
- `getDevices()` - Fetch available Zigbee2MQTT devices
- `getLearningStats()` - Get adaptive learning statistics for an area
- `getHistoryConfig()` - Fetch history retention settings
- `setHistoryRetention(days)` - Update retention period (1-365 days)
- `getHistory(areaId, options)` - Flexible history queries with hours, startTime, endTime
- Plus schedule, preset modes, boost mode, window/presence sensors, and HVAC mode endpoints

### TypeScript Types

See `src/types.ts` for all interface definitions:
- `Zone` - Area configuration, state, schedules, night boost, smart learning
- `Device` - Zigbee2MQTT device information
- `ScheduleEntry` - Time-based schedule data
- `HistoryEntry` - Temperature history record
- `LearningStats` - Adaptive learning statistics

## Key Features

### Smart Scheduling
- Time-based temperature profiles
- Day-of-week selection
- Multiple schedules per area
- Enable/disable individual schedules

### Night Boost
- Configurable temperature increase during night hours
- Customizable start and end times (default: 22:00-06:00)
- Adjustable offset (0-3°C)
- Per-area enable/disable
- Supports periods crossing midnight (e.g., 23:00-07:00)

### Smart Night Boost (Adaptive Learning)
- Machine learning system that predicts optimal heating start times
- Learns heating patterns from historical data
- Weather correlation with outdoor temperature sensors
- Configurable target wake-up time
- Automatic prediction improvement over time
- Real-time learning statistics and progress tracking
- Dedicated Learning tab showing:
  - Learning status and configuration
  - Learning process explanation
  - API endpoint information

### Development Logs (v0.5.4+)
- **Per-Area Logging System**: Complete visibility into heating strategy decisions
- **Dedicated Logs Tab**: Chronological log of all heating events
- **Event Types Tracked**:
  - Temperature: Target calculations and effective temperature changes
  - Heating: State changes with current/target temperatures
  - Schedule: Activations with preset modes or temperatures
  - Smart Boost: Predictions, start times, duration estimates
  - Sensor: Window and presence sensor state changes
  - Mode: Manual override mode changes
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Filter dropdown for specific event types or all events
  - Refresh button for on-demand log updates
  - Color-coded event type badges (heating=red, temperature=blue, schedule=green, etc.)
  - Detailed JSON data display for each event
  - Timestamps with date and time
- **Memory-Efficient**: 500-entry limit per area using deque
- **API Integration**: `GET /api/smart_heating/areas/{area_id}/logs?limit=N&type=EVENT_TYPE`

### Temperature History
- **Configurable Retention**: 1-365 days (default: 30 days)
- **Recording Interval**: Every 5 minutes (fixed)

- **Temperature Sensors**: Show "19.5°C" from temperature attribute
- **Valves**: Show "45%" position without redundant state
- **Fallback**: Shows "unavailable" when no data available
- Color-coded icons for instant visual feedback
- Real-time updates via WebSocket and coordinator (30s)

### Drag & Drop
- Drag devices from panel to area cards
- Visual feedback on drop targets
- Automatic refresh after assignment

## Accessing the Frontend

Once built and deployed, access the frontend through:

1. **Home Assistant Panel**: Navigate to the "Smart Heating" panel in the sidebar (🔥 icon)
2. **Direct URL**: `http://your-ha-instance:8123/smart_heating/`

## Troubleshooting

### API Calls Failing

Make sure your Home Assistant instance is running and the Smart Heating integration is installed and configured.

### Build Errors

Clear node_modules and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Hot Reload Not Working

Make sure you're accessing the dev server directly at `localhost:5173`, not through Home Assistant.

### WebSocket Not Connecting

Check that Home Assistant is running and the integration is loaded. Check browser console for connection errors.
