## 📋 Supported Device Types

### Per-Area Devices
- **Thermostat** - Room thermostats for direct temperature control
- **Temperature Sensor** - External temperature measurement for area monitoring
- **Valve/TRV** - Smart radiator valves with **dynamic capability detection**
  - **No device-specific code** - System queries Home Assistant entity attributes at runtime
  - **Works with ANY valve model** from any manufacturer
  - Control mode determined by entity capabilities:
    - **Position control**: Entity has `number.*` domain OR `climate.*` with `position` attribute
    - **Temperature control**: Entity has `climate.*` domain with `temperature` attribute
  - Examples (for reference only, not hardcoded):
    - TuYa, Danfoss, Eurotronic, Sonoff, or any other TRV brand
    - Position-controlled valves: Opens to max when heating, min when idle
    - Temperature-controlled valves: Sets to `target+offset` when heating, `idle_temp` when idle
  - Works with any external sensor brand
- **Switch** - Circulation pumps, relays, or zone valves (any brand)
  - Automatically turns ON when area needs heating
  - Automatically turns OFF when area is idle

### Global Devices
- **OpenTherm Gateway** - Single gateway for boiler control (shared across all areas)
  - Aggregates heating demands from all areas
  - Controls boiler on/off based on any area needing heat
  - Sets optimal boiler temperature (highest requested + 20°C overhead)

## 🏗️ Heating Architecture

Smart Heating uses an intelligent multi-device control strategy:

### Device Assignment by Area
Each area can contain multiple device types that work together:

```
Living Room Area:
├── climate.living_room_thermostat (optional - direct control)
├── sensor.living_room_temperature (required - for monitoring)
├── climate.living_room_trv_1 (valve with temp control)
├── climate.living_room_trv_2 (valve with temp control)
└── switch.living_room_pump (floor heating pump)

Bedroom Area:
├── sensor.bedroom_temperature (required)
├── number.bedroom_valve (valve with position control)
└── switch.bedroom_pump

Global Configuration:
└── climate.opentherm_gateway (boiler control - shared)
```

### Heating Control Flow

1. **Temperature Monitoring**: External sensors measure area temperature
2. **Heating Decision**: Compare current vs target (with hysteresis)
3. **Per-Area Actions** (when heating needed):
   - **Thermostats**: Set to target temperature
   - **Switches**: Turn ON (pumps, relays)
   - **Valves**: Dynamic control based on capabilities
     - **Position control** (if supported): Open to 100%
     - **Temperature control** (fallback): Set to `target + 10°C` to ensure valve opens
       - Example: For TS0601 TRV at 21°C target → Set TRV to 31°C (opens valve fully)
4. **Global Boiler Control**:
   - If ANY area needs heating → Boiler ON
   - Set boiler to: `max(all_area_targets) + 20°C`
   - If NO areas need heating → Boiler OFF

### Why This Design?

- **Shared Boiler**: One OpenTherm gateway serves all areas efficiently
- **Independent Zones**: Each area controls its own circulation and valves
- **Smart TRV Fallback**: Works with TRVs that don't support direct position control
- **External Sensors**: Accurate temperature measurement independent of TRV location
- **Energy Efficient**: Boiler only runs when needed, optimal temperature setting

## 🚀 Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Coming Soon)

This integration will be available via HACS in the future.

### Method 2: Manual Installation via SSH

1. **SSH into your Home Assistant OS:****
   ```bash
   ssh -p 22222 root@homeassistant.local
   ```

2. **Navigate to custom_components:**
   ```bash
   cd /config/custom_components
   ```

3. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheFlexican/smart_heating.git temp
   mv temp/custom_components/smart_heating .

**Example:**
```yaml
service: smart_heating.set_trv_temperatures
data:
  heating_temp: 25.0   # Fallback if target+offset is lower
  idle_temp: 10.0      # Closes valve when area idle
  temp_offset: 10.0    # Add 10°C to target (21°C target → 31°C TRV)
```

**How it works**:
- For area target 21°C: TRV set to `max(21+10, 25)` = 31°C when heating
- When idle: TRV set to 10°C (closes valve)
- System queries each valve's capabilities automatically

**Note**: Only applies to TRVs without position control (e.g., TS0601 _TZE200_b6wax7g0). Position-controlled valves (number.* entities) use direct 0-100% control.

type: thermostat
entity: climate.area_living_room
```

Or use switch cards:

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: switch.area_living_room_control
  - entity: climate.area_living_room
    type: custom:simple-thermostat
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Components

- **Area Manager** - Manages heating areas, devices, and schedules
- **Climate Controller** - Controls thermostats based on temperature and schedules (updates every 30 seconds)
- **Schedule Executor** - Applies time-based temperature schedules (checks every minute)
- **Coordinator** - Fetches device states from Home Assistant (30-second interval)
- **History Tracker** - Records temperature data for visualization (5-minute intervals)
- **REST API** - HTTP endpoints for frontend and external integrations
- **WebSocket** - Real-time updates for frontend

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + MUI)

- **ZoneCard** - Area overview with device status and temperature control
- **AreaDetail** - Detailed area view with tabs for overview, schedules, and history
- **ScheduleManager** - Create and manage time-based temperature profiles
- **TemperatureChart** - Interactive temperature history visualization
- **DeviceList** - Drag-and-drop device assignment

### Device Control Flow

1. **Temperature Monitoring**: Coordinator fetches sensor data → Climate Controller calculates average per area
2. **Heating Decision**: Climate Controller compares current vs target (with hysteresis) → Sends commands to thermostats
3. **Schedule Application**: Schedule Executor checks active schedules → Updates area target temperature
4. **Thermostat Control**: Climate Controller sends `climate.set_temperature` to TRVs
5. **TRV Response**: Physical TRV adjusts valve position → Reports back via MQTT
6. **Display Update**: Coordinator fetches updated states → WebSocket pushes to frontend

**Note**: With mock devices, the valve position doesn't respond to commands since there's no physical hardware. Real TRVs would automatically adjust valve position based on temperature commands.

### Debug Logging

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.smart_heating: debug
```
