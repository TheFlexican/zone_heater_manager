    - Temperature-controlled valves: Sets to `target+offset` when heating, `idle_temp` when idle
  - Works with any external sensor brand
- **Switch** - Circulation pumps, relays, or zone valves (any brand)
  - Automatically turns ON when area needs heating
  - Automatically turns OFF when area is idle

### Global Devices
- **OpenTherm Gateway** - Single gateway for boiler control (shared across all areas)
  - Aggregates heating demands from all areas
  - Controls boiler on/off based on any area needing heat
  - Sets optimal boiler temperature (highest requested + 20°C overhead)

## 🏗️ Heating Architecture

Smart Heating uses an intelligent multi-device control strategy:

### Device Assignment by Area
Each area can contain multiple device types that work together:

```
Living Room Area:
├── climate.living_room_thermostat (optional - direct control)
├── sensor.living_room_temperature (required - for monitoring)
├── climate.living_room_trv_1 (valve with temp control)
├── climate.living_room_trv_2 (valve with temp control)
└── switch.living_room_pump (floor heating pump)

Bedroom Area:
├── sensor.bedroom_temperature (required)
├── number.bedroom_valve (valve with position control)
└── switch.bedroom_pump

Global Configuration:
└── climate.opentherm_gateway (boiler control - shared)
```

### Heating Control Flow

1. **Temperature Monitoring**: External sensors measure area temperature
2. **Heating Decision**: Compare current vs target (with hysteresis)
3. **Per-Area Actions** (when heating needed):
   - **Thermostats**: Set to target temperature
   - **Switches**: Turn ON (pumps, relays)
   - **Valves**: Dynamic control based on capabilities
     - **Position control** (if supported): Open to 100%
     - **Temperature control** (fallback): Set to `target + 10°C` to ensure valve opens
       - Example: For TS0601 TRV at 21°C target → Set TRV to 31°C (opens valve fully)
4. **Global Boiler Control**:
   - If ANY area needs heating → Boiler ON
   - Set boiler to: `max(all_area_targets) + 20°C`
   - If NO areas need heating → Boiler OFF

### Why This Design?

- **Shared Boiler**: One OpenTherm gateway serves all areas efficiently
- **Independent Zones**: Each area controls its own circulation and valves
- **Smart TRV Fallback**: Works with TRVs that don't support direct position control
- **External Sensors**: Accurate temperature measurement independent of TRV location
- **Energy Efficient**: Boiler only runs when needed, optimal temperature setting

## 🧠 Adaptive Learning System

Smart Heating includes a machine learning engine that learns your home's heating characteristics and optimizes heating schedules automatically.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Learning**: Every heating cycle is recorded with:
   - Start and end temperatures
   - Time taken to reach target
   - Outdoor temperature (if weather sensor configured)
   - Calculated heating rate (°C per minute)

2. **Data Storage**: Uses Home Assistant's Statistics API
   - Efficient database storage (SQLite or MariaDB)
   - No file-based storage overhead
   - Statistics tracked per area:
     - `heating_rate`: How fast the area heats up
     - `cooldown_rate`: How fast it cools down
     - `outdoor_correlation`: Impact of outdoor temperature
     - `prediction_accuracy`: How accurate predictions are

3. **Predictive Scheduling**: Smart Night Boost feature
   - Configure desired wake-up time (e.g., 06:00)
   - System predicts heating time based on:
     - Current temperature
     - Target temperature
     - Current outdoor temperature
     - Historical learning data
   - Automatically starts heating at optimal time
   - Includes safety margin to ensure target is reached

### Configuration

**Per Area:**
- `smart_night_boost_enabled`: Enable/disable adaptive learning for this area
- `smart_night_boost_target_time`: Desired time to reach target temperature (e.g., "06:00")
- `weather_entity_id`: Outdoor temperature sensor for weather correlation (optional)

**Example:**
```yaml
# Via service call
service: smart_heating.set_night_boost
data:
  area_id: living_room
  smart_night_boost_enabled: true
  smart_night_boost_target_time: "06:00"
  weather_entity_id: sensor.outdoor_temperature
```

### Learning Statistics API

Access learning data via REST API:
```bash
GET /api/smart_heating/areas/{area_id}/learning
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "area_id": "living_room",
  "stats": {
    "total_events": 45,
    "avg_heating_rate": 0.15,
    "avg_outdoor_correlation": -0.65,
    "prediction_accuracy": 0.92,
    "last_updated": "2024-12-04T10:30:00"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Advanced Heating Features

Smart Heating includes advanced features for enhanced comfort and energy efficiency.

### Preset Modes

Quick temperature presets for common scenarios. Each preset has a default temperature that can be customized per area.

**Available Presets:**
- **NONE** - Use manual temperature or schedule
- **AWAY** (16°C) - Energy-saving when nobody's home
- **ECO** (18°C) - Economical heating
- **COMFORT** (22°C) - Maximum comfort
- **HOME** (20°C) - Standard home temperature
- **SLEEP** (19°C) - Optimal sleeping temperature
- **ACTIVITY** (21°C) - Active room usage
- **BOOST** (24°C) - Quick heat-up

**Usage:**
```yaml
service: smart_heating.set_preset_mode
data:
  area_id: "living_room"
  preset_mode: "comfort"
```

**Temperature Priority:**
Preset modes override schedules. Priority order:
1. Boost mode (highest)
2. Window open (reduces temp)
3. Preset mode
4. Schedule temperature
5. Manual target temperature
6. Night boost (additive)
7. Presence boost (additive)

### Boost Mode

Temporary high-temperature override for quick heating. Perfect for rapid warm-up when coming home.

**Features:**
- Configurable duration (5-180 minutes)
- Optional custom boost temperature (default: 24°C)
- Automatic expiry and return to normal operation
- Visual indication in frontend

**Usage:**
```yaml
# Boost for 30 minutes at default temp
service: smart_heating.set_boost_mode
data:
  area_id: "living_room"
  duration: 30

# Boost for 60 minutes at custom temp
service: smart_heating.set_boost_mode
data:
  area_id: "bedroom"
  duration: 60
  temperature: 25.0
```

**Cancel Boost:**
```yaml
service: smart_heating.cancel_boost
data:
  area_id: "living_room"
```

**REST API:**
```bash
# Activate boost
POST /api/smart_heating/areas/living_room/boost
{"duration": 30, "temperature": 24}

# Cancel boost
POST /api/smart_heating/areas/living_room/cancel_boost
```

### Window Sensor Integration

Automatically adjusts heating when windows/doors open to save energy.

**How It Works:**
1. Add window/door sensors to an area
2. When any sensor detects "open" state
3. Target temperature is automatically reduced by configured amount (default: 5°C)
4. Heating returns to normal when all windows closed
5. Status logged for monitoring

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# Add window sensor
service: smart_heating.add_window_sensor
data:
  area_id: "living_room"
  entity_id: "binary_sensor.living_room_window"

# Remove window sensor
service: smart_heating.remove_window_sensor
data:
  area_id: "living_room"
  entity_id: "binary_sensor.living_room_window"
```

**Customization:**
Per-area settings (in `area_manager.py`):
- `window_open_action_enabled`: Enable/disable feature (default: true)
- `window_open_temp_drop`: Temperature reduction in °C (default: 5.0)

**REST API:**
```bash
# Add sensor
POST /api/smart_heating/areas/living_room/window_sensors
{"entity_id": "binary_sensor.living_room_window"}

# Remove sensor
DELETE /api/smart_heating/areas/living_room/window_sensors/binary_sensor.living_room_window
```

### Presence Detection

Boost temperature when presence/motion is detected for enhanced comfort.

**How It Works:**
1. Add presence/motion sensors to an area
2. When motion detected → automatic temperature boost (default: +2°C)
3. When no presence → boost removed
4. Works additively with other temperature settings
5. Ideal for rooms used intermittently

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# Add presence sensor
service: smart_heating.add_presence_sensor
data:
  area_id: "home_office"
  entity_id: "binary_sensor.office_motion"

# Remove presence sensor
service: smart_heating.remove_presence_sensor
data:
  area_id: "home_office"
  entity_id: "binary_sensor.office_motion"
```

**Customization:**
Per-area setting (in `area_manager.py`):
- `presence_temp_boost`: Temperature increase in °C (default: 2.0)

**Supported Sensor Types:**
- Motion sensors (`binary_sensor` with `device_class: motion`)
- Occupancy sensors (`device_class: occupancy`)
- Presence sensors (`device_class: presence`)
- Person detection sensors

**REST API:**
```bash
# Add sensor
POST /api/smart_heating/areas/home_office/presence_sensors
{"entity_id": "binary_sensor.office_motion"}

# Remove sensor
DELETE /api/smart_heating/areas/home_office/presence_sensors/binary_sensor.office_motion
```

### Frost Protection

Global minimum temperature setting to prevent freezing in all areas.

**How It Works:**
1. Enable frost protection globally
2. Set minimum temperature (default: 7°C)
3. If any area's target falls below minimum → automatically raised to frost protection temperature
4. Applies even when areas are disabled
5. Safety feature for winter vacations

**Configuration:**
```yaml
service: smart_heating.set_frost_protection
data:
  enabled: true
  temperature: 7.0
```

**Use Cases:**
- Winter holidays (prevent pipe freezing)
- Empty properties
- Seasonal properties
- Backup safety measure

**REST API:**
```bash
POST /api/smart_heating/frost_protection
{"enabled": true, "temperature": 7.0}
```

### HVAC Modes

Support for different HVAC operation modes per area.

**Available Modes:**
- **HEAT** - Heating mode (default)
- **COOL** - Cooling mode (for AC-equipped areas)
- **AUTO** - Automatic heating/cooling
- **OFF** - System off (overrides all settings)

**Usage:**
```yaml
service: smart_heating.set_hvac_mode
data:
  area_id: "bedroom"
  hvac_mode: "heat"
```

**Behavior:**
- **OFF mode**: Area completely disabled, no heating commands sent
- **HEAT mode**: Normal heating operation
- **COOL/AUTO modes**: Framework ready for future AC support

**REST API:**
```bash
POST /api/smart_heating/areas/bedroom/hvac_mode
{"hvac_mode": "heat"}
```

### Schedule Copying

Duplicate schedules between areas or days to save time.

**Features:**
- Copy from one area to another
- Copy to specific days of week
- Copy all schedules at once
- Unique IDs automatically generated

**Usage:**
```yaml
# Copy Monday schedule to Tuesday-Friday
service: smart_heating.copy_schedule
data:
  source_area_id: "living_room"
  source_schedule_id: "monday_morning"
  target_area_id: "living_room"
  target_days:
    - "tue"
    - "wed"
    - "thu"
    - "fri"

# Copy entire area schedule to another area
service: smart_heating.copy_schedule
data:
  source_area_id: "living_room"
  target_area_id: "bedroom"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Weekday schedule replication
- Duplicate successful schedules to other rooms
- Quick setup of similar areas
- Seasonal schedule templates

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Temperature Calculation Priority

Smart Heating uses a sophisticated 7-level priority system to determine the final target temperature:

1. **Boost Mode** (Highest Priority)
   - Temporary override
   - Time-limited
   - Typically 24-26°C

2. **Window Open Detection**
   - Reduces target by configured amount
   - Default: -5°C
   - Immediate response

3. **Preset Mode Temperature**
   - Away: 16°C, Eco: 18°C, Comfort: 22°C, etc.
   - Overrides schedule

4. **Schedule Temperature**
   - Time-based temperature profiles
   - Different temps for different times

5. **Base Target Temperature**
   - Manual setting
   - Fallback value

6. **Night Boost** (Additive)
   - Adds to current target
   - Default: +0.5°C during night hours

7. **Presence Boost** (Additive)
   - Adds to current target
   - Default: +2°C when presence detected

**Example Calculation:**
```
Base schedule: 20°C
+ Preset mode (COMFORT): → 22°C
+ Presence detected: +2°C → 24°C
- Window open: -5°C → 19°C
= Final target: 19°C
```

### Sensor State Monitoring

The climate controller automatically monitors all configured sensors every 30 seconds:

**Window Sensors:**
- State values considered "open": `on`, `open`, `true`, `True`
- All other states considered "closed"
- Multiple sensors per area supported (any open triggers action)

**Presence Sensors:**
- State values considered "detected": `on`, `home`, `detected`, `true`, `True`
- All other states considered "no presence"
- Multiple sensors per area supported (any detection triggers boost)

**State Caching:**
Sensor states are cached in area objects:
- `area.window_is_open` - Boolean
- `area.presence_detected` - Boolean
- Updates logged for monitoring

- Restarts Home Assistant automatically
- Takes ~30 seconds total

## 💻 Development Setup

For developers who want to contribute or customize the integration:

### Quick Setup (macOS)

```bash
# Run automated setup script
./setup_dev_environment.sh

# Open in VS Code and reopen in DevContainer
code .
# Press Cmd+Shift+P → "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

The setup script installs:
- Homebrew (if not installed)
- Docker Desktop
- VS Code and required extensions
- DevContainer environment

See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for detailed development instructions.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Add the Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ ADD INTEGRATION**
3. Search for **Smart Heating**
4. Click on it to add (no configuration needed)

### 2. Configure OpenTherm Gateway (Optional)

If you have an OpenTherm gateway for boiler control:

  heating_temp: 25.0   # Fallback if target+offset is lower
  idle_temp: 10.0      # Closes valve when area idle
  temp_offset: 10.0    # Add 10°C to target (21°C target → 31°C TRV)
```

**How it works**:
- For area target 21°C: TRV set to `max(21+10, 25)` = 31°C when heating
- When idle: TRV set to 10°C (closes valve)
- System queries each valve's capabilities automatically

**Note**: Only applies to TRVs without position control (e.g., TS0601 _TZE200_b6wax7g0). Position-controlled valves (number.* entities) use direct 0-100% control.

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Setup Workflow

1. **Install the integration** via the Home Assistant UI
2. **Add areas** in Home Assistant (Settings → Areas & Zones)
3. **Add devices** to areas using the web interface or service calls
4. **Configure temperatures** via climate entities or service calls
5. **Manage areas** via switches or service calls

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# Complete setup example for floor heating with boiler
automation:
  - alias: "Configure Smart Heating System"
    trigger:
      - platform: homeassistant
        event: start
    action:
      # Configure global OpenTherm gateway
      - service: smart_heating.set_opentherm_gateway
        data:
          gateway_id: "climate.opentherm_gateway"
          enabled: true
      
      # Configure TRV settings (automatically applies to temp-controlled valves)
      - service: smart_heating.set_trv_temperatures
        data:
          heating_temp: 25.0   # Fallback temperature
          idle_temp: 10.0      # Close valve when idle
          temp_offset: 10.0    # Add to target for heating (dynamic)
      
      # Setup Living Room area
      - service: smart_heating.add_device_to_area
        data:
          area_id: "living_room"

          area_id: "bedroom"
          device_id: "number.bedroom_valve_position"
          device_type: "valve"
```

### Dashboard Integration

Add climate cards to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: thermostat
entity: climate.area_living_room
```

Or use switch cards:

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: switch.area_living_room_control
  - entity: climate.area_living_room
    type: custom:simple-thermostat
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Components

- **Area Manager** - Manages heating areas, devices, and schedules
- **Climate Controller** - Controls thermostats based on temperature and schedules (updates every 30 seconds)
- **Schedule Executor** - Applies time-based temperature schedules (checks every minute)
- **Coordinator** - Fetches device states from Home Assistant (30-second interval)
- **History Tracker** - Records temperature data for visualization (5-minute intervals)
- **REST API** - HTTP endpoints for frontend and external integrations
  - `/api/smart_heating/areas` - Area management
  - `/api/smart_heating/devices` - Device listing
  - `/api/smart_heating/config` - System configuration (OpenTherm, TRV settings)
  - `/api/smart_heating/status` - System status
- **WebSocket** - Real-time updates for frontend
- **Config Flow** - Integration setup with options flow for OpenTherm configuration

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + MUI)

- **ZoneCard** - Area overview with device status and temperature control
- **AreaDetail** - Detailed area view with tabs for overview, schedules, and history
- **OpenThermStatus** - Real-time OpenTherm gateway monitoring with visual status indicators
- **ScheduleManager** - Create and manage time-based temperature profiles
- **TemperatureChart** - Interactive temperature history visualization
- **DeviceList** - Drag-and-drop device assignment

### Device Control Flow

1. **Temperature Monitoring**: Coordinator fetches sensor data → Climate Controller calculates average per area
2. **Heating Decision**: Climate Controller compares current vs target (with hysteresis) → Sends commands to thermostats
3. **Schedule Application**: Schedule Executor checks active schedules → Updates area target temperature
4. **Thermostat Control**: Climate Controller sends `climate.set_temperature` to TRVs
5. **TRV Response**: Physical TRV adjusts valve position → Reports back via MQTT
6. **Display Update**: Coordinator fetches updated states → WebSocket pushes to frontend

**Note**: With mock devices, the valve position doesn't respond to commands since there's no physical hardware. Real TRVs would automatically adjust valve position based on temperature commands.

### Debug Logging

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.smart_heating: debug
```
